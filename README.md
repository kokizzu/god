# God - Go-daemons

God (go-daemons) is a tool to deploy and manage daemons in the Go ecosystem on GNU/Linux machines
using [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).

God installs your go binary in the remote machine (server) using `go install`,
create the systemd unit file (.service file) and allows you to
start/stop/restart the process.

## Use case

I often write small micro-services or web-services in Go, and I need to deploy
the service on a server in an easy and fast way, without bothering! Usually I
compile the executable for the server architecture, log in via SSH on the
server, copy the binary, create the configuration file for the new systemd
service, install it and start the process. A series of commands that are always
the same but that I forget every time and have to look in my notes somewhere.
And that's not all: when I make a change to my program, then I have to recompile
it, log in via SSH on the server, copy the binary and restart the service. A
real waste of time!

So I decided to write God, a tool written in Go. With God I can quickly and
easily deploy and manage one or more services written in Go comfortably from my
laptop, without logging into the server via SSH using a simple
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration file.

## Install God

```
go install github.com/pioz/god@latest
god -h
```

## Usage

ðŸ“’ **To read the list of all commands and options run `god -h`**.

God uses a simple YAML file like this one to understand what to do:

```yaml
my_service_name1:
  user: pioz
  host: 119.178.21.21
  go_install: github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server@latest
my_service_name2:
  user: pioz
  host: 119.178.21.22
  go_install: github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server2@latest
```

You can install a new service on a remote server with the following command:

```
god -f conf/file.yml install my_service_name1
```

If you omit the `-f` option, God will try to find the conf file in `.god.yml`
path.

Now, what happens?

God will try to connect via SSH to the server `119.178.21.21` with the user
`pioz` on the default SSH port 22 using the private key stored locally in
`~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Currently, only authentication via private key is supported and
authentication via plain password is not planned. Then perform this sequence of
commands:

1. Check if Go is installed on the remote host
2. Check if systemd is installed on the remote host
3. Check if the user `pioz` is in the [lingering list](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/loginctl.html)
4. Install the Go package `github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server@latest` in `$GOBIN` (default `$GOBIN`)
5. Create the systemd unit service file in `~/.config/systemd/user/`
6. Reload systemd daemon with `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
7. Enable the new service with `systemctl --user enable my_service_name1`

The systemd unit service file will be saved in
`~/.config/systemd/user/my_service_name1.service` and its content is
something like this:

```
[Unit]
Description=my_service_name1

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/home/pioz
ExecStart=/home/pioz/go/bin/go_hello_world_server

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Now you can start the service with

```
god start my_service_name1
```

that will run in the remote host

```
systemctl --user start my_service_name1
```

If you want rollback and clean your server you can uninstall the service with
`god uninstall my_service_name1`.

### Install from private repository

If your Go service package is located in a private repository, God allows the
remote server to access the repository prepending in the remote
[`~/.netrc`](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html)
file the login information that you can specify on the God YAML configuration
file (read `god -h` for more details). An example here:

```yaml
my_private_service:
  user: pioz
  host: 119.178.21.21
  go_install: github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server_private@latest
  # Private repo access
  go_private: github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server_private
  netrc_machine: github.com
  netrc_login: githublogin@gmail.com
  netrc_password: youRgithubAcce$$tok3n
```

### Override YAML configuration options with env variables

All configuration options that you can specify in the `.god.yml` file can be
overridden with environment variables in the form
`<SERVICE_NAME>_<OPTION_NAME>`. For example, the option `netrc_password` can be
overridden with the environment variable `MY_PRIVATE_SERVICE_NETRC_PASSWORD`.
This is really useful if you want to avoid storing sensitive data in the
`.god.yml` file.

So you can install your private service with this command:

```
MY_PRIVATE_SERVICE_NETRC_PASSWORD=youRgithubAcce$$tok3n god install
```

Notice that God uses [this
function](https://github.com/pioz/god/blob/c6d5e174596d584d348f4c74b69086c13533a01f/runner/runner.go#L282)
to convert the service name in the environment variable. So all characters not
in `[A-Za-z0-9_]` will be replaced by an underscore.

### Manage multiple services at the same time

If you do not specify a service name, all services defined in the YAML file will
be taken into consideration, for example if you run `god restart` it will
restart all services defined in the YAML file in parallel. ðŸ¤©

This is really useful if your infrastructure is made by many microservices.

### Copy files

If you need to upload files to the remote working directory you can use the
configuration options `copy_files` in the YAML conf file. For example you can
upload a `.env` file needed by your service.

```yaml
my_service_name:
  user: pioz
  host: 119.178.21.21
  go_install: github.com/pioz/go_hello_world_server@latest
  copy_files:
    - .env
    - WARNING.txt
    - /home/pioz/icons/
```
